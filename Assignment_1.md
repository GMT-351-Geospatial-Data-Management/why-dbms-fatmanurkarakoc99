A database management system(DBMS) is a software system consisting of multiple programs in which various complex operations are performed, such as creating a new database, editing, developing and maintaining a database. Instead of using spreadsheets, we need to use database management systems, because database management systems have many advantages over spreadsheets. For example, database management systems ensure the security of data. There are very strict mechanisms in place to prevent data from being corrupted willingly or as a result of misuse. In addition to protecting the user name and password to enter the database, people can only see the tables that interest them or certain columns in the table. It is a good feature that users cannot access every field. For this, various powers are assigned, and along with the data, these powers are also stored. The data that each user will access can be defined individually. With the permissions and restrictions, the desired user access settings are set. But spreadsheets do not offer data protection mechanisms to protect data from poorly trained users. DBMS ensures data integrity and consistency. For example, an updated address information in one place will also be updated in another place. But spreadsheets provide minimal data validation, so an updated address in one place can remain updated in another place. DBMS reduces data repetition, that is, the same data is not stored repeatedly on different people's computers or on different computers. DBMS prevents data repetition, that is, the same data is not contained repeatedly in different files. This allows the data to take up less space. DBMS can be updated multiple times, which means that when we change any of the data that is repeated in more than one file, the data in other files changes at the same time. When we examine our surroundings nowadays, we realize that database management systems are actually working behind many events. For example, the conversation times of subscribers by phone companies are stored in databases for the month, and by the end of the month, the phone bill of each subscriber is calculated one by one by client programs. An English-Turkish dictionary can be easily written in this way. A library tracking automation, a hospital automation, accounting programs and many other automation programs are basically database projects.
